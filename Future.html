        <h2>Future Improvements</h2>
        <p> In the future, we hope to implement a feature where plant owners can
        write and see reviews of different plant sitters. We also plan to add a 
        search engine that finds plant sitters based on what type of plant the 
        plant owner owns, so that the plant sitter knows how to deal with that 
        specific species. Another goal is to implement a feature that confirms a
        plant sitter's eligibility, such as a badge or testing system. With more
        time, we will also redesign our app for a professional look.  </p>
        <p> We will keep you up to date with improvements on this website!</p>
